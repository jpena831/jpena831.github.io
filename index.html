        <p>Presently, I am an incoming Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Macalester College in St. Paul, MN and I hold an online adjunct faculty appointment at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. I just defended my dissertation toward the Informatics PhD Degree in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at <a href="www.psu.edu">The Pennsylvania State University</a>. </p>
          
         <p> There, I was an MPHD Sloan Scholar and a CRA-E fellow. And I was also a part of the Computer-Supported Collaboration and Learning laboratory which is under the supervision of Drs. <a href="https://jcarroll.ist.psu.edu/">Jack Carroll</a> and <a href="https://mrosson.ist.psu.edu">Mary Beth Rosson</a> (also my advisor). I held a 14-month internship assignment as a research associate at Honeywell Aerospace under their Human-Centered Systems Group.</p>

        <p>Prior to the abovementioned, I defended my Master’s Thesis entitled, “An Investigation of Technology Design Features for Inverted Classroom Teaching” in August 2015 (also at Penn State). In May of 2013, I received my B.A. in <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/academics/schools-colleges/arts-sciences/academics/departments-and-centers/computing-sciences/ba-in-multimedia-Web-design-and-development.aspx">Multimedia Web Design and Development</a> from the <a href="https://hartford.edu">University of Hartford.</a></p>

       <!-- <p>I am currently working on {SUMMARY LIST OF PROJECTS} with {COLLABORATORS, IF ANY} through the {UNIVERSITY|INSTITUTE|COMPANY, IF ANY}.</p> -->

        <div id="read-more">

          <p class="push-down-2">Besides graduate school, I have several other interests like, traveling, driving, cooking, puzzles/trivia and dabbling with new technology. I also spend massive amounts of time aimlessly surfing the web for random facts. I am a Netflix junkie, I binge-watch many many shows. Some of my favorites are LOST, Fringe, 30 Rock, the X-files, Arrested Development and much more! Likewise, I am a huge film nerd, I have some favorite all-time films, directors and actors.</p>
